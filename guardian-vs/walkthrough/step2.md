# Deep Codebase Intelligence

**Guardian starts with broad context and explores deeply where needed.**

Guardian is designed with inherent codebase intelligence. It doesn't operate in a vacuum, but starts with a structural understanding of your project. Before making changes, it performs targeted agentic exploration to gain any additional specific context required, ensuring its actions are always well-informed and aligned with your architecture.
