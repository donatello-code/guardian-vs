## Your AI Coding Partner That Actually Gets Things Done

Guardian VS is an autonomous coding agent that works directly in your IDE, combining the power of state-of-the-art AI models with practical tools to handle real development tasks. Unlike simple code assistants, Guardian VS thinks like a developer—planning, executing, and adapting as he works through complex problems.

### Core Capabilities

**🤖 Intelligent Task Execution**
- **File Operations**: Create, edit, and refactor code with full diff review before changes are applied
- **Terminal Integration**: Run commands, install dependencies, start servers, and monitor output in real-time
- **Browser Automation**: Test web applications, debug visual issues, and interact with live sites
- **Project Analysis**: Understand your codebase through AST parsing, regex searches, and smart context management

**🔧 Advanced Tool Integration**
- **Multi-Model Support**: Use Claude, GPT, Gemini, and 50+ other models via OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, and local providers
- **MCP Ecosystem**: Extend capabilities with custom tools for Jira, AWS, databases, APIs, and more
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Monitor linter errors, compiler issues, and runtime problems as you work

### Real-World Use Cases

**🚀 Rapid Prototyping**
- Convert mockups/images into functional applications
- Bootstrap new projects with proper architecture
- Implement features from vague requirements

**🔍 Debugging & Maintenance**
- Fix bugs with screenshots and error logs
- Refactor legacy code with confidence
- Update dependencies and migrate frameworks

**📈 Project Enhancement**
- Add tests, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines
- Optimize performance and fix security issues
- Implement new features based on user feedback

**🛠️ Custom Workflows**
- Create MCP tools for your specific stack (Jira, AWS, internal APIs)
- Automate repetitive development tasks
- Integrate with your team's existing tools and processes

### Why Developers Love Guardian VS

**✅ Human-in-the-Loop Safety**
Every file change and terminal command requires your approval. Guardian VS shows diffs, explains his reasoning, and waits for your go-ahead—no surprises, no unauthorized changes.

**🧠 Context-Aware Intelligence**
Guardian VS analyzes your project structure, reads relevant files, and builds understanding before making changes. He manages context intelligently to handle large projects without overwhelming token limits.

**⚡ Practical Autonomy**
From running `npm install` to debugging a production issue, Guardian VS handles the grunt work while you focus on high-level decisions. He adapts to your environment, toolchain, and preferences.

**🔄 Checkpoint System**
Save and restore workspace snapshots at any point. Experiment with different approaches, compare results, and roll back changes—all without losing progress.

### Getting Started

1. **Install** from VS Marketplace
2. **Configure** your preferred AI provider (OpenRouter recommended for model variety)
3. **Describe** what you want to build or fix
4. **Review & Approve** each step as Guardian VS works
5. **Iterate** based on results and feedback

### Perfect For
- **Developers** who want to ship faster with AI assistance
- **Teams** adopting AI-powered development workflows
